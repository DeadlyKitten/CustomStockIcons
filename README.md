## Installation

The easiest way to install this is to use the [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/slimemodmanager/releases/latest).


#### Manual Installation
*If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST!*
Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract `BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip` directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Then, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/CustomStockIcons/releases/latest) and extract the zip into your plugins folder (`BepInEx/plugins`).

## Usage

Place icons in `BepInEx/plugins/Steven-CustomStockIcons/Custom Icons` (run the game with the mod installed if you don't see this folder).

**Icons must be in .png (preferred) or .jpg format!** The size in-game is 64x64, so aim for something around that size for optimal quality.

Only use one per character, additional icons will be ignored! The name of the image determines the character it's for (you can use either the ID or the character's name).

#### This mod comes with default icons that replace the stars in the vanilla game. If you wish to disable those, edit the config at `BepInEx/config/com.steven.nasb.stockicons.cfg` and set `Use Vanilla Icons` to true.
